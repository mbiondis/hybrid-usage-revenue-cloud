# Hybrid Usage Add-on

This package implements the logic needed to create products with a Hybrid Usage sell model. This is common in software companies that sell allowances for API calls, platform logins, or payment providers that process transactions and charge for overspend. These units are each tracked by individual Usage Meters, which are then added together using the Usage Accumulator. The latter contains the information of the allowance (referred to as Credits) and applies an overage surcharge if the credit limit is exceeded.
